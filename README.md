# Audio Signal Analysis Tool

A Flask-based web application for analyzing audio signals using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) methods. Users can upload audio files and select the desired analysis type to view the resulting signal transformation.

## Features
- Upload audio files (WAV format).
- Select analysis type: FFT or DFT.
- Generate and display transformation plots.
- Simple and responsive user interface with styling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-signal-analysis-tool.git
   cd audio-signal-analysis-tool
Run the application:

python main.py
Access the app in a web browser: Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to open the web interface.

Analyze Audio:

Upload a .wav file.
Choose FFT or DFT as the analysis type.
Click "Analyze" to generate and view the analysis plot.
Example
Upload an audio file (e.g., sample.wav) in the application.
Select the desired transformation (FFT or DFT).
The resulting plot image will be displayed on the results page.
